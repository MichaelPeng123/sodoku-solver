# Sudoku Solver

This short project allows the user to play the popular puzzle game Sodoku. 

I also coded up a short algorithm that uses backtracking and caching to solve any board matrix that the user inputs into the code. 

Instructions on how to use:
1. Run the main python script
2. Click and enter numbers to play, inputs can also be deleted with the delete key
3. Press space to solve the board instantly and the "c" key to clear board after solving
4. Press the "a" key to animate the solving process (sit back and watch)

Hope you enjoy this short project.
